so).

Synopsis
--------

This repository exists solely for learning purposes. In fact, I don't even
encourage you using it. Go away.

No? Alrighty! I always knew you wouldn't let me down. Let me tell you something,
then. I'm merely working through that famous Cormen's book and sometimes take
the liberty of peeking into other sources, so you may see here some stuff that
wasn't mentioned in “Introduction to Algorithms”. Maybe not. God knows what's
in that book, because I haven't finished reading it! And maybe never will!
